## Quotes
> Plato concluded that most people are unfit by training and ability to make the difficult and necessary decisions that would result in a just society. The “average person” lacks wisdom and self-restraint. As Plato saw things, most people make emotional responses based on desire and sentiment rather than on rational considerations stemming from an objective view of what is genuinely good for the individual and society.

>  In order to increase wealth, “money people” need to stimulate irrational but constant consumption by everyone else. Plato declares, “It should then be clear that love of money and adequate self-discipline in its citizens are two things that can’t co-exist in any society; one or the other must be neglected.”
