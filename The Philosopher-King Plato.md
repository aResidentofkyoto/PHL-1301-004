##  Explain why Plato needed Forms. 

He comes up with this to distinguish knowledge and opinions (Beliefs)

> The Platonic Forms are independently existing, nonspatial, nontemporal “some- things” (“kinds,” “types,” or “sorts”) that cannot be known through the senses. Known in thought, these Forms are not ideas in the usual sense. Knowledge is always about Forms

# Class notes

#Plato means broad (something about broad shoulders)
Seemed good at everything.
Plato wrote a boat ton of stuff.

## #Plato's response to #Socrates Death
1. Open #The_Academy. In order to teach the next generation to not do stupid things like killing #Socrates. Top Student #Aristotle 
2. He wrote about #Socrates to continue his Ideas. Most important was considered the apology.
3. He concluded that democracy was the failure. He writes *The Republic* to outline a Utopian society.
## #Plato talks about Atlantis
Lead to many questions about if he made it up or was it some sort of mythological thing.

## Quotes
> Plato concluded that most people are unfit by training and ability to make the difficult and necessary decisions that would result in a just society. The “average person” lacks wisdom and self-restraint. As Plato saw things, most people make emotional responses based on desire and sentiment rather than on rational considerations stemming from an objective view of what is genuinely good for the individual and society.

>  In order to increase wealth, “money people” need to stimulate irrational but constant consumption by everyone else. Plato declares, “It should then be clear that love of money and adequate self-discipline in its citizens are two things that can’t co-exist in any society; one or the other must be neglected.”

## Forms 
They exist through time ([[The Philosopher-King Plato#Explain why Plato needed Forms.]])
By interacting with things you cant find the forms but what it does is a form.
Before birth you live in the world of forms. When moving in to "reality" you lose most of the forms but you still have some left (you can tell when something is beautiful)

Even if the physical things that have such forms disappear that form still exists.
This establises some truth that can be defined
