## Early life 
> John Stuart Mill’s destiny was sealed when Jeremy Bentham befriended his father, who became one of Bentham’s younger disciples. From Bentham, James Mill came to believe that all minds are the same at birth and that proper education— begun early enough—would produce a healthy, rational child. Bentham and James Mill decided to use little John Stuart to show just how effective Bentham’s ideas were.

## Education 

> Basing their program in part on Bentham’s own experiences as a child prodigy, the experimenters saw to it that John Stuart learned Greek and arithmetic at three; Latin, geometry, and algebra at eleven; and logic and philosophy at twelve. Though not everything went smoothly (young John Stuart had some trouble with Plato’s Theaetetus), he was such a whiz at math that he had to teach himself once he had surpassed his father’s abilities.9 In an effort to refine John Stuart’s thinking and to prevent “the mere cramming of the memory,” James Mill forced John Stuart to try to learn everything for himself before James would even consider explaining it.
