# Book Notes

## Socratic problem

#Socrates Wrote nothing so everything second source 

> In his impressive book Socrates, the renowned classical scholar W. K. C. Guthrie says, “Any account must begin with the admission that there is, and always will be, a ‘Socratic problem.’” 1 In the first place, Socrates wrote nothing.

## Paradigmatic individual

> These human paradigms possess a timeless quality, according to Jaspers. They serve as archetypal images for their cultures and usually speak to other cultures as well. Although different cultures and eras produce different archetypes (Jaspers used as his examples Socrates, Confucius, Buddha, and Jesus), the archetypal individual’s very nature demands a response: What is it to be a human being? What is most important? What is good? How should I live?

## #Socrates Claim of innocence

> Socrates always insisted that his “wisdom” lay in knowing what he did not know.

> We saw in Chapter 2 that the sage was considered “strange” and “alien,” atopos in Greek. But this kind of strangeness can be trivialized or dismissed as merely odd or eccentric. The paradigmatic individual may be just as “strange” as the sage, but in a manner that is more personally disturbing, more deeply unsettling to our everyday habits and values.

# #Class Notes

## #Socrates info
470-399 BCE
#Socrates taught #Plato → #Plato taught #Aristotle → #Aristotle taught Alexander the Great

Wrote nothing down. Everything is secondary source from #Plato or others.

More of a wanderer who debated people.

> Critobulus has challenged Socrates to use his famous question-and-answer method (we’ll look at this shortly) to prove that Socrates is “more beautiful” than Critobulus. 
> 	Critobulus: All right, but which of our noses is the more beautiful? 
> 	
> 	Socrates: Mine, I should say, if the gods give us noses to smell with, for your nostrils point to earth, but mine are spread out widely to receive odours from every quarter. 
> 	
> 	Critobulus: But how can a snub nose be more beautiful than a straight one? 
> 	
> 	Socrates: Because it does not get in the way but allows the eyes to see what they will, whereas a high bridge walls them off, as if to spite them. 
> 	
> 	Critobulus: As for the mouth, I give in, for if mouths are made for biting you could take a much larger bite than I. 
> 	
> 	Socrates: And with my thick lips don’t you think I could give a softer kiss? 
> 	
> 	Critobulus: By your account I seem to have a mouth uglier than an ass’s. . . . I give up. 
> 	
> 	Let’s put it to the vote, so that I may know as quickly as possible the forfeit I have to pay.7 When the votes were counted, Socrates lost unanimously, prompting him to accuse Critobulus of bribing the judges.

Order of discussing with a sophist
1. complement sophist is open
2. ask question (what is {insert thing})
3. ask same question changed around
4. unrelated questions
5. rotated back to contradict first question

## Oracle thing
Someone talked to an Oracle, and they said he was wise-er then himself

Went to finds a smarter person, but never found anyone.

## “All that I know is that I know nothing” - #Socrates 
There is a truth, but I don't know anything, but I'm aware that I don't know

question “is that like material or not” No permanent knowledge

## Knowledge vs Opinion
Knowledge is a justified true believe cannot be wrong
Opinion is you thought about a fact/truth and can be wrong

## #Sophists have opinions not knowledge according to #Socrates 
#Socrates wants to show that but never does. Plato gets it done. 

## #Socrates Death

Made lots of enemy
charged with corrupting the minds of Athens and not following the gods
Didn't leave and went to trial
He believed he was helpful and fights it.

Doesn't apologize and says he isn't corrupting them. Then recommends he gets free food and luxury.

Sentenced to death

gave opportunity to escape didn't take it

didn't escape and faced his death
# Discussion 

1. How is relativism dangerous?
Can be used the make morally bad opinions in the same level as everything else. Implement ignorance. **With no truth then what is wrong.** Method can be relativistic and become dangerous. 

2. How do we prove that knowledge exists?
Knowledge by existence? How do we have knowledge when everything is chagning.
