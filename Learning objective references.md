## Explain the Socratic problem. 


#Socrates Wrote nothing so everything second source

> In his impressive book Socrates, the renowned classical scholar W. K. C. Guthrie says, “Any account must begin with the admission that there is, and always will be, a ‘Socratic problem.’” 1 In the first place, Socrates wrote nothing.

## Define the concept of the paradigmatic individual.
Someone with timeless wisdom and which a culture judges is a perfect human being. 

>  In other words, Socrates is a genuine archetypal individual, or, in a term coined by philosopher and psychologist Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), a paradigmatic individual. Jaspers applied the term to a special class of teachers, philosophers, and religious figures whose nature becomes a standard by which a culture judges the “ideal” human being.

> These human paradigms possess a timeless quality, according to Jaspers. They serve as archetypal images for their cultures and usually speak to other cultures as well. Although different cultures and eras produce different archetypes (Jaspers used as his examples Socrates, Confucius, Buddha, and Jesus), the archetypal individual’s very nature demands a response: What is it to be a human being? What is most important? What is good? How should I live?

## Summarize the encounter between Socrates and Thrasymachus. 

> A key element in keeping his pupils engaged, and calling attention to the impor- tance of meaning, was Socrates’ use of irony, a way of communicating on more than one level. An ironic utterance has at least two levels of meaning: the literal level, also known as the obvious level, and the hidden level, also known as the real level.
