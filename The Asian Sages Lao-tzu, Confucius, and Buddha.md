## Laozi (Lao-tzu) 
575 B.C.E

> Chapter 1 of the Tao te Ching:
> 	(1) The Tao that can be told of Is not the absolute Tao; The Names that can be given Are not the Absolute Names. The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the Mother of All Things.9 
> 	(2) As for the Way, the Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way; As for names, the name that can be named is not the constant name. The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things; The named is the mother of the ten thousand things

#Class : You can not pin down what Tao is

### Vagueness in eastern philosophy
It makes it open to more interpretation and harder to prove. It leads to greater adoption. More connection to everyone.

### Yin & Yang

> yin (passive, weak, negative, dark, and destructive) and yang (active, strong, positive, light, and constructive)

[[Archetypes of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy -- Douglas J_ Soccio -- 9, 2015 -- Cengage Learning -- 9781285874319 -- 98784a9b5983cd9ff9c6585bc5f1d5b6 -- Anna’s Archive.pdf#page=63&selection=33,70,35,13|Archetypes of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy -- Douglas J_ Soccio -- 9, 2015 -- Cengage Learning -- 9781285874319 -- 98784a9b5983cd9ff9c6585bc5f1d5b6 -- Anna’s Archive, page 63]]

Relative

Currently, people generally prefer yang. Being productive etc.
Yin is more of default. It's harder to go from yang to yin.

contentness vs gain of more??

### Non action

> wu wei: Literally “not to act”; in the Tao te Ching, a warning against unnatural or demanding action

## Confucius
551-497 B.C.E

> "Guide the people by governmental measures,” he said, “and regulate them by the threat of punishment, and the people will have no sense of honor and shame. Guide the people by virtue and regulate them by li (rules of conduct and sense of propriety), and the people will have a sense of honor and respect”

### Difference of Laozi vs Confucius idea of Tao

> In contrast to Lao-tzu’s let-it-be sense of Tao, Confucius confines the meaning of Tao to the proper course of human conduct and the organization of government. Confucius’s focus on the organic relation of Tao and human virtue (te) marked the first time those concepts came to philosophical prominence in Chinese philosophy.

Laozi had a more vibes based idea of Tao, while Confucius led the idea that it should define human conduct.

## Buddha

Siddhārtha Gautama (c. 560–480 b.c.e.)

#### TLDR:
Sheilded from reality by parents
Escaped and saw [[Notes#Four signs]]



### Four signs

>  During secret trips outside the palace to a nearby city, he saw three of the now-famous Four Signs that altered his life forever: a destitute and homeless beggar, a dead man being prepared for cremation by weeping mourners, and a diseased and handicapped person.

### Four Noble Truths

> The Buddha’s basic teachings rest on what are called the Four Noble Truths: 
> 1. No one can deny that suffering is the condition of all existence. 
> 2. Suffering and general dissatisfaction come to human beings because they are possessive, greedy, and, above all, self-centered. 
> 3. Egocentrism, possessiveness, and greed can, however, be understood, overcome, rooted out.
> 4. This rooting out, this vanquishing, can be brought about by following a simple, reasonable Eightfold Path of behavior in thought, word, and deed. Change of viewpoint will manifest itself in a new outlook and new patterns of behavior.

### Nirvana

> which the Buddha sat became known as the Bodhi Tree—the Tree of Wisdom. Finally, the awakening came. What Buddhist tradition refers to as the “greatest event in human history” occurred during the full moon of May, c. 524 b.c.e.

### Caviot of Buddhism as a philosophy

> Ultimately, Buddha calls on us to adopt a way of life, rather than “a philosophy,” as we in the West understand “having a philosophy.” Buddha insisted that to discover the truth, we must somehow set aside the kind of “analytic thinking” that leads to establishing schools of Buddhism or to quibbling over the correct interpretation of various texts. (In this, he reminds us of Lao-tzu and other Taoist sages.)

### Middle path
