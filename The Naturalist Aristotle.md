# Learning Objectives
## Explain why #Aristotle accused #Plato of mistaking intellectual analysis for ontological status.

> Aristotle warned that we must take care not to mistake intellectual analysis for ontological status. Aristotle accused Plato of doing just that by imputing actual existence to the Forms. For Aristotle, form exists within the natural order embedded in particular things and cannot exist independently.

## Distinguish between Aristotelian forms and Platonic Forms. 

[[The Philosopher-King Plato#Forms]] are hard to prove because there is no evidence to prove. While [[Archetypes of Wisdom An Introduction to Philosophy -- Douglas J_ Soccio -- 9, 2015.pdf#page=197&selection=32,0,32,4|Aristoles forms]] don't rely on a non-provable thing.
## Define matter according to #Aristotle
Matter is the stuff that makes up everything

> From the Greek hyle, the common material stuff found in a variety of things; it has no distinct characteristics until some form is imparted to it or until the form inherent in a thing becomes actualized.

## Define entelechy. 

That everything exists for a reason or is from some natural process.

> Entelechy means that things do not just happen; they develop according to natural design

## Distinguish between eudaemonia and happiness. 

Everyone moves towards eudaemonia through entelechy.

### Things you need for eudaemonia 
- Social life
- Struggle (like #Buddha)
- Happiness / pleasure
- Knowledge
- Wealth
- Fame
- Virtue 

> Often translated as “happiness”; term Aristotle used to refer to fully realized existence; state of being fully aware, vital, alert.

> A rich and full life is a social life.

> The rational person alone knows how to engage in life fully, since he or she alone has fully realized all three souls: the nutritive, sensitive, and rational—according to the basic form or entelechy of human beings.21 The good life must be lived fully; it is a process, an activity, a becoming, not a static condition.

## Criticize the claim that a life governed by sophrosyne will be dull, rigid, and boring. 

If everything is the same then there is no contrast or diversity.
### Sophrosyne Define
> Wisdom as moderation; hitting the mark; quality of finding the mean between excess and deficiency.

## Explain the relationship of habit to moral virtue for Aristotle. 
## Give an example of a character trait for which there is no Aristotelian mean. 

> From the Greek charakter, a word derived from charassein, “to make sharp” or “to engrave,” the sum total of a person’s traits, including behavior, habits, likes and dislikes, capacities, potentials, and so on; a key element of Aristotelian ethics and psychology, meaning the overall (generally fixed) nature or tone of a person’s habits.

## Compare today’s widespread understanding of happiness as a subjective state with Aristotle’s characterization of happiness as a by-product of a well-balanced life.

Starts another school after he didn't get the job at #The_Academy. 

## He gets blamed for holding back stuff

## Naturalism 

Things proven with actual physical stuff. Rejection of #Plato's forms

Defined: Belief that reality consists of the natural world; denial of the existence of a separate supernatural order of reality; belief that nature follows orderly discover-able laws

Humans are animals to. (Not special beings)

## #Aristotle  forms
Compared to #Plato's Forms. He brings it to earth

#Aristotle says you can't think of green (a form) without seeing a green (object that has form) thing.


> Form (Aristotelian) From the Greek word for essence (ousia), that which is in matter and makes a thing what it is; can be abstracted from matter but cannot exist independently of matter.

### Matter
Matter can become a form when it's in the shape of form.

### Formed Matter
Its the same matter but the forms it has changes.

## How to acquire knowledge
1. Material Cause - What is the stuff?
2. Formal Cause - What forms does it have?
3. Efficient Cause - How did it come to be?
4. Final Cause - Reason/ Function
